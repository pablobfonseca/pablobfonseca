I am a software engineer, passionate about learning and programming, vim evangelist, yes I like to use both (evil-mode on emacs brings the best of the both worlds ğŸ˜œ). I have worked on several projects for international companies, I like to be challenged and learn new ways of doing things.

ğŸš€ I work for [Upscope](https://upscope.com) as a Lead Software Engineer.

ğŸŒ± I'm improving my Typescript, Go and FP (Haskell and Elm) skills.

âš¡ Fun fact: I love human languages as much as I love programming languages, I am currently trying to learn a few languages in my spare time: ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µğŸ‡°ğŸ‡·ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡±
